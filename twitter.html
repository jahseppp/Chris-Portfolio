        <h2>Having won the Carabao Cup four years in a row, Manchester City have now not been past the quarter-finals of the competition in the last three seasons.

            Nathan Jones' Southampton ended Pep Guardiola's bid for all four trophies last season, although City fans won't have minded given what happened in Istanbul a few months later.
            
            Newcastle will provided for a City side that hosted eight changes from Saturday's match with Nottingham Forest, with Erling Haaland staying on the bench. Rodri served the first of his three-game ban for his red card at the weekend.
            
            Alexander Isak's goal eight minutes after half-time proved to be the difference despite City dominating the majority of the play in both halves.
            
            The result denotes City's earliest exit in the Carabao Cup since 2012. It's also the first time Pep Guardiola has lost a third round domestic cup game since taking over.</h2>
